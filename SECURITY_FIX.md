# Security Vulnerability Fix - GO-2024-3244

## üö® Vulnerability Details

**CVE:** GO-2024-3244  
**Severity:** High  
**Component:** github.com/consensys/gnark  
**Issue:** Out-of-memory during deserialization with crafted inputs  

### Description
The Gnark library had a vulnerability that could cause out-of-memory conditions when processing crafted inputs during deserialization. This could be exploited for denial-of-service attacks against applications using ZK-SNARK proof generation and verification.

### Affected Code Paths
The vulnerability affected multiple functions called by our proof generation:
- `main.go:90:29: zkTest1.generateProof calls groth16.Setup`
- Multiple curve implementations (bls12, bls24, bn254, bw6)

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Gnark Library
```diff
- github.com/consensys/gnark v0.11.0 (vulnerable)
+ github.com/consensys/gnark v0.12.0 (fixed)
```

### 2. Updated Related Dependencies
```diff
- github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto v0.14.0
+ github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto v0.15.0

- golang.org/x/crypto v0.32.0  
+ golang.org/x/crypto v0.35.0

+ Other indirect dependencies updated for compatibility
```

### 3. Additional Security Updates
- Fixed golang.org/x/crypto vulnerability GO-2025-3487
- Updated all transitive dependencies to latest secure versions
- Verified no breaking changes in API usage

## üîí Verification

### Security Scan Results
